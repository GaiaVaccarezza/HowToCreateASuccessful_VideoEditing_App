Given our analysis, it is advisable to create a video-editing app only for Google Play Store. In this
platform the review scores are higher as well as the number of ratings. 

It is also reasonable to say that we would be able to charge a price for it, due to its positive effect on the popularity of the app.
Heuristically, it would be 0.99€, meaning the lower possible. Such choice could be motivated by the
willingness to spark interest in users, which are empirically eager to review well a paid application.
At the same time, we would cover production costs without the need for in-app purchases or longterm subscriptions,
which showed to be likely to cause dissatisfaction in customers.

The size constraint would be important, since it might slow the device of the users. This idea should
not be extremized given evidence that dimension may be a proxy for good quality. Intuitively,
applications with more features and better editing software occupy more memory, controlling for
space-optimized development. A risk-less choice would be around 200 MB, the average of our mostly
centered distribution. Incidentally, a reasonable size would avoid frequent app
crashes, provided that the there are no systematic bugs.

As a last note, design will be a crucial part of the app. Our analysis highlighted that this aspect is
very much appreciated by customers, especially when efficient in terms of the keywords ’user-friendly’
and ’clear’. Given our numerical results, a potential starting point in terms of specific binary features
would be:
• Stabilizer
• Remove Middle Part
• Free Vlog Music
• Adjust Speed
• Templates
• Sync Text with video
• Filter
• Save video
• Share on social networks
• Export video
• Add music
• Stop Motion
• Green screen
It is important to stress that this is not an exclusive list but just a collection of factors that might
turn out to be influential.

A combination of the above arguments, thanks to the generality of our scraped data, would be a
principled starting point to think about how to devise a video-editing app that successfully answers
our main research question. Our Hypotheses have been discussed throughout the text and proved
to be at least interesting perspectives, which at the same time suggested to design a broader view of
our set of information.
