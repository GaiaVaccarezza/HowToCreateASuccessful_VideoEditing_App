During the Marketing and Innovation course of my Master of Science we had to produce an analysis of a phenomenon using Web Scraping and Machine Learning. Therefore, three collegues of mine and I decided to 
focus on videoediting applications and the key factors determining their performance in terms of success and popularity. 

Our motivation lies in the recent rise of interest towards innovative types of online content, with the success
of reels and TikTok short videos. Both formats potentially benefit from post processing creatorsâ€™ productions. In this context, video-editing apps are light smartphone tools that can support the
finalization of a recording. 

We performed scraping of data, like reviews or number of downloads, from application stores of iOS and Android devices. Such raw information was then processed in different ways to formulate meaningful analysis
on whether certain features or properties of the application itself have an impact on the user-level score or the app-level score. Such analysis, after a thoughtful graphical exploration, were carried out
systematically with classical models, like linear regression or order logit, to inspect the magnitude of dependence. Morever, we investigated the presence of meaningful bigram (group of two words) in the reviews after a detailed cleaning of all the strings. 

Given our results we commented on potential points of focus if we were asked to develop a video-editing application
that would be well-rated on the current market.

A more detailed description of the project and the result is in the REPORT and in the SLIDES file.
